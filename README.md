# Findr
A submission for Mississauga Hacks 2020.

Findr is your one-stop to find out “how it’s working” during this pandemic.

It is a simple platform where users can get information about parks, clinics, shops, facilities, and more. You can get important information such as how they are operating, the measures they are taking for social distancing, and how pickup and delivery work.

Users can view information and about a specific store, facility, or amenity, such as the Home Depot.

Users, if logged in, can also add information about a specific store, facility, or amenity.

Admins can delete submissions if required.
